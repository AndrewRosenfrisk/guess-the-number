# Guess the Number

## About

Guess the Number is a classic game for beginners to practice basic programming 
techniques. In this game, the computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100. 
The player has 10 chances to guess the number. After each guess, the computer tells 
the player if it was too high or too low.
